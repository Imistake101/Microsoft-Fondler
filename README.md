## this script is for me and has my preferences so if you dont like it go kick rocks
# if you are on windows 11 24h2, this script will break steam because the implementation of bbrv2 in 24h2 is completely broken. the solution is to not use 24h2 because its just too buggy.
This is only meant for desktop x86_64 Windows 10 and 11.
The script requires a restart to fully apply.

I cannot figure out how to remove some default apps on windows 11 (spotify, linkedin, whatsapp, etc) as they dont appear as appx packages, so you will have to remove them manually.
