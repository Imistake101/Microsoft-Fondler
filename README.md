## this script is for me and has my preferences so if you dont like it go kick rocks
This is only meant for desktop x86_64 Windows 10 and 11.
The script requires a restart to fully apply.

I cannot figure out how to remove some default apps on windows 11 (spotify, linkedin, whatsapp, etc) as they dont appear as appx packages, so you will have to remove them manually.
